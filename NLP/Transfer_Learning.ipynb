    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings algorithms like word2vec and GloVe provide a mapping of words to a high-dimensional continuous vector space where different words with a similar meaning have a similar vector representation. These word embeddings, pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled data, are used to initialize the first layer of a neural network called embedding layer, the rest of the model is then trained on data of a particular task. This kind of transfer learning in NLP problems is shallow as learning is transferred to only the first layer of the model, the rest of the network still needs to be trained from scratch. A model initialized with word embeddings needs to learn from scratch not only to disambiguate words, but also to derive meaning from a sequence of words. \n",

    "\n",
    "A language model attempts to learn the structure of natural language through hierarchical representations, and thus contains both low-level features (word representations) and high-level features (semantic meaning). A key feature of language modelling is that it is generative, meaning that it aims to predict the next word given a previous sequence of words. It is able to do this because language models are typically trained on very large datasets in an unsupervised manner, and hence the model can “learn” the syntactic features of language in a much deeper way than word embeddings "

The reason for that is that now the label of our dataset is not the text itself, but the Sentiment of the review. However, it is important to pay attention that when loading the data we are specifying a parameter called vocab which value is assigned to data_lm.vocab. The reason for that is that we want to ensure that both datasets will use the same encoding for the same words. For that to happen the vocabulary has to remain the same. In this way, if the word \"bank\" is mapped to [1,0,0], it will remain mapped to that number in this dataset. Pay also attention that now we are splitting the dataset in 2, for training and testing"
